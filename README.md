# Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) Simulation Project ðŸš€

## Overview
This repository contains the code, data, and simulation framework for a **Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) system** as part of our NSSS / ISRO research project. The goal is to simulate key aspects of a nuclear thermal rocket, including reactor heating, propellant expansion, and performance metrics like **thrust** and **specific impulse**.  

The project focuses on:
- Flowchart and algorithmic representation of an NTP system.
- Python-based toy simulations using reactor and propellant data.
- Data analysis and visualization to explore NTP performance trends.

> **Note:** This is a **research simulation**, not a physical reactor model. All results are based on theoretical calculations and open-source data.
